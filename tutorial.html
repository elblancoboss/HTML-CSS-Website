		<h3>Tutorial on how to use the 4-3-3 Formation in Association Football</h3>
		</header>
		
<p>The 4-3-3 system - that is four defenders, three midfielders and three attackers - allows you to have three attackers while 
still having a strong midfield. </p>
<p>The three midfielders will normally play quite closely together to give protection to the defence and so they cannot be 
passed around by the opposition. </p>
<p>The three strikers will split across the pitch to provide width to the attack. </p>
<p>The 4-3-3 is one of the most popular and successful formations, with both international and domestic teams mastering it.
 Here, we'll explore how it works and who uses it.

<p>This formation is traditionally preferred by a lot of Dutch 
coaches and teams, to the point where Ajax are expected to field
 a 4-3-3 every game by their fans. This was also the preferred 
 formation by FC Barcelona in their recent golden era of 2004-06
 with Messi and Ronaldinho flanking Eto’o up front.
 This is a more attacking option than a 4-5-1 or 4-2-3-1 
 (and the like), however the formation can be converted
 to either of those whenever defence is a priority over 
 attack. This formation requires a traditional big man
 or #9 up front as a target man and to hold the ball up. 
 The three midfielders can either be a combination of two 
 attacking and one holding/defensive, or vice-versa.<p>

	<p>In the 4-3-3 formation the defenders will play a typical flat back four with a <b>right back 
	(Alves)</b>, a <b>left fullback (Marcelo)</b> and <b>two central defenders (Ramos and Godin)</b>. <b>Marcelo on the 
	left</b> and <b>Alves on the right</b> will join the <b>three midfield players (Busquets, Modric and Iniesta)</b>
	when possible in attacking play, often providing an overlap run to get crosses into the penalty 
	area. <b>Marcelo</b> and <b>Alves</b> will drift into the middle to cover <b>Ramos</b> and <b>Godin</b> when the ball is 
	being advanced down their opposite wing. One of the positives of playing four at the back is that
	it is very common and the players involved in the four positions at the back will likely have played
	in flat back fours many times, so they should be very experienced in this formation. It really is the 
	standard defensive formation around the world.<p>
	
	<p>The three midfielders perform different defensive and offensive roles. At the centre, often playing just 
	in front of the four defenders, there is a <b>defensive midfielder (Busquets)</b> whose job it is to break up opposition attacks
	before releasing the ball to teammates. Busquets perform this role for Barcelona. He doesn’t score many
	goals, but his role in the team should not be understated as his teammates can attack in the knowledge that they 
	have a dependable tackling midfielder behind them.<p>
	
	<p>There are <b>two players (Modric and Iniesta)</b> flanking the <b>defensive midfielder (Busquets)</b> whose duty it is both to defend and attack. 
	These box-to-box  midfielders should be getting into the opposition's penalty area regularly with the aim 
	of finishing off the chances created by the wide attacking players. It is also their job to construct attacking 
	moves once they have received the ball from one of the four defenders or defensive midfielder. For these roles 
	to be carried out well, such players need to have superb passing abilities, like Barcelona's <b>Andres Iniesta</b> and 
	Real Madrid's <b>Luka Modric.</b><p>
	
	<p>Offensive Forwards on either side of the striker are instructed to use their pace to get at full-backs 
	and cross the ball in for the central striker and advancing midfielders. It is important that these wide players 
	have the skill and technique needed to beat opposing defenders. In Real Sociedad’s Carlos Vela and Real Madrid’s 
	Cristiano Ronaldo - we have two prime supporters of this art. Often you will see these types of players cut inside
	and run at the central defenders, regularly playing quick passing exchanges with teammates before getting into the 
	penalty area and releasing a shot. Ronaldo, for example, plays on the left of the central striker but being right-footed 
	he loves to cut inside before shooting or passing. While it is the central striker's job to score goals, these players
	are also expected to weigh in.<p>
	
	<p>The formation relies on an out-and-out striker to play in the centre of the front three, capable of holding the
	ball up and bringing the two players on either side of him into the play. In Barcelona's case this is often Lionel 
	Messi. His other main function is to be on the end of chances created.<p>
	
	<h3>Instructions for each player</h3>
	<p><b>Goalkeeper (GK)</b> (Casillas) - You will stay in goal inside your 18-yard penalty area and will save any incoming balls to prevent conceding a goal.<p>
	<p><b>Right Back (RB)</b> (Alves) - Your job is to stay on the right side of the defence line and help the other defenders to tackle the opponent's strikers. When we are attacking I expect you to run forward on the right side of the pitch and to pass the ball to the right winger or to cross the pall into the opponents penalty area where our strikers will try to head or volley the ball as an attempt to score a goal.<p>
	<p><b>Centre Backs (CB)</b> (Godin and Ramos) - You are our central defenders so your job will be to defend our goal from any dangerous attacks by blocking any shots and tackling the opponents strikers. When we are attacking I need you to pass the ball forward to our midfielders or to our left or right wingers. When we have a corner kick I need you to go forward so you can attempt to head the ball as you are both tall and you will be good for crossed balls.<p>
	<p><b>Left Back (LB)</b> (Marcelo) - Your job is to stay on the left side of the defence line and help the other defenders to tackle the opponent's strikers. When we are attacking I expect you to run forward on the left side of the pitch and to pass the ball to the left winger or to cross the pall into the opponents penalty area where our strikers will try to head or volley the ball as an attempt to score a goal.<p>
	<p><b>Central Defensive Midfielder (CDM)</b> (Busquets) - Your role is primarily required to break down opposition attacks and augment the defense. However, because you are often in possession of the ball when the opponent has committed players to an attack, you also need to initiate the team’s own attacks.<p>
	<p><b>Central Midfielders (CM)</b> (Modric and Iniesta) - You two will be in the same area as the defensive midfielder but this is to enable better protection for yourselves, which are your roles is to influence the team’s attacking game. You need to take advantage of the extra support to spray passes up to the attackers and prompt quick offense.<p>
	<p><b>Right Wing (RW)</b> (Vela) - Your role includes pressurising the opposition Left Back, attacking from the right wide position and providing crosses into the box. You also have to score goals, as you have the chance to cut inside into deep positions and cause problems for defenders on the right side of the pitch. <p>
	<p><b>Left Wing (LW)</b> (Ronaldo) - Your role includes pressurising the opposition Right Back, attacking from the left wide position and providing crosses into the box. You also have to score goals, as you have the chance to cut inside into deep positions and cause problems for defenders on the left side of the pitch. <p>
	<p><b>Striker (ST)</b> (Messi) - You need to play mainly in the penalty area and acts as a focal point for attacks. You need to be good opportunistic and header the ball on the opponent’s goal. Basically you just need to stay up front and strike the ball towards the opponents goal.<p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> These are just typical example instructions for each player, and the instructions may vary from one manager's opinion to another.<p>
