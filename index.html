<p>In this week I took few minutes to look round the CI135 space on StudentCentral. 
Then learnt how to locate my personal web space Web which is my W: drive, 
and looked at my default home page in a browser but my personal web homepage was almost blank as it had nothing done yet,
plus created and published a basic home page. </p>

<p>In week 2 I started the learning journal and added a publication date to my posts, then put a list in a post and 
created navigation within a page using anchors and used the img tag â€“ to add an image and done an Email link.</p>

<p>In week 3 I added another list to my learning journal which is my Resources list, and learnt how to add a table which I inserted my semester 1 timetable for my Computer Science (Games) cource. 
They are new features I learnt this week and my homepage is certainly looking better as a starter.</p>

<p>This week I started learning the basics of CSS, firstly I attached the 'Getting started' stylesheet to my web page, and played around with the codes to style the body elements. The stylesheet helped to re-style my web page and made it easier to style it.</p>

		<p>Published on <time datetime="2014-11-11">November 11, 2014</time></p>
		</header>
<p>Week 5 was challenging as I had to sort out the layout of my Learning Journal Page because it was not very organised. I learnt how to Create the layout structure in HTML and new rules with id and class selectors in my stylesheet. I had a problem with floating the sidebar to the right as I had an image which made it difficult to float the side bar, so I had to move the image and create more space, this allowed me to float the image as well and wrap text around it.</p>

		<h3><a id="week6"></a>WEEK 6. CSS: tables and lists</h3>
		<p>Published on <time datetime="2014-12-07">December 7, 2014</time></p>
		</header>
<p>I found creating tables and lists very useful for my learning journal webpage as I have learnt how to insert a table and I used that table to show my semester 1 timetable to my learning journal webpage visitors. Creating a new HTML table was not too easy as the table has many lines of codes that it was too confusing to start with but after playing around with it I started to understand more about how to add more rows or boxes or text inside the boxes. Styling the table was another tough experience as I had to play around with colour codes and border margins and how they collapse. Using Firebug and ColorZilla made the experience a lot easier and helped me a lot to choose between colours as I had no idea about what are the colour codes and I highly recommend using ColorZilla to the beginners that are trying to style their webpages and tables to use it.</p>

		<p>Using stylesheets was a new thing to me and I realised how important they were when I first used a stylesheet when it completely changed the way my learning journal webpage looked and there were a lot of features to play around that will make the webpage look more presentable.  This week I learnt how to link 2 different stylesheets to one webpage and making one of them the default one. Personally I made 2 different stylesheets and linked them to my index page and Iâ€™ve set up stylesheet 1 to be the default one, and the users can view my webpage on my 2nd stylesheet if they preferred. Learning more about font families and types was also helpful that now I can choose between different fonts depending on my preferences. I have looked at Google webfonts and they were easy to understand the differences and to choose between them. 
Styling paragraphs was a great feature to know as it helped me to style my paragraph and learning posts however I wanted to make them look presentable. ColorZilla and Firebug were helpful tools to use when styling a webpage and they made it easy for me to style my webpage and to point at different sections of the webpage.</p>

		<p>For me I used ColorZilla to pick up colours because it was an easy tool to use and to choose different colours for styling my webpage. This week I learnt how to set a background image to my webpage. At first I really wanted to set a background image for my webpage but I did not know how to do it, but this weekâ€™s lab tutorial and by using W3Schools, they really helped me understand how to set a background image to a webpage which I did. In order for setting up a background image I had to learn how to control repeating images. By setting up a background image to my webpage I made my index page more presentable and professional which I had to choose a suitable background image in order to make my webpage look presentable and professional.</p>

		<h3><a id="week9"></a>WEEK 9. HTML and CSS forms</h3>
		<p>Published on <time datetime="2015-01-05">January 5, 2015</time></p>
		</header>
		<p>Making CSS form was a great thing to learn and to add to my learning journal, I will be using this form page to allow my learning journal visitors to send me any feedback regarding my learning journal. Inserting a form on the webpage was not very tough as I had to use the form tag in order to insert a form. Adding form elements to the contact form was an essential part to build up my contact form. Adding elements such as the name, email address and website address for the user to fill in his/her details so it will enable me to contact them regarding their feedback or at least to make me aware of who there are.  Using a fieldset really separates out the different sections of a form and it makes the form more orientated and organised. I also learnt how to add a text area and how to set up its size, the comment area enables the user to post any comments he/she has regarding my learning journal. Radio group was a nice element to add to my contact form which I used to ask the user if they prefer to receive more information from me, and at the end I inserted a submit input element which is a submit button to submit the form to me. For my stylesheet I used the form styling radio and submit input types in order to make them inputs. CSS forms are essential and they can be used however the user wants and they do not really have to be contact forms.<p>
